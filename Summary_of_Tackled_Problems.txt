Technical Summary: Problems and Solutions
=========================================

Problem 1: JPEG Compression Artifacts (Data Integrity)
MS Paint JPEGs use lossy compression, which causes pure black pixels to shift into
various shades of dark gray. A strict "color == black" check would fail to detect
these lines.
Solution:
The application utilizes a luminance threshold (averaging the R, G, and B channels)
rather than an exact color match. Any pixel with a brightness value below the 50%
threshold (128) is identified as black, ensuring consistent detection despite
compression noise.

Problem 2: Performance Bottlenecks in White Space (Algorithm Optimization)
Scanning every single pixel in high-resolution images can be computationally
expensive, especially in empty images where a "Fast Path" hit isn't possible.
Solution:
A Tiered Probing algorithm was implemented. Based on the requirement that target
lines are continuous, the algorithm probes the vertical midpoint and quarter-marks
first. This achieves O(1) detection per column for the vast majority of cases,
while an exhaustive fallback scan is retained only as a secondary measure to
guarantee 100% accuracy.

Problem 3: Error Handling and Application Stability (Defensive Programming)
Handling absolute file paths via command-line arguments can lead to crashes if
the path is invalid, permissions are restricted, or the file is not an image.
Solution:
The application implements a multi-layered exception hierarchy. Specific blocks
catch FileNotFoundException, SecurityException, and IOException to provide clear,
actionable feedback to the user. A final generic catch-all handler ensures the
application fulfills the "must not crash" requirement, providing stability in
unforeseen edge cases.
